# Web_Scraping using Beautiful soup

https://agmarknet.gov.in/ is an Indian government webportal to deliver the basic information of all the commodities publically sold in India. 

### Problem statements:
Lets say you want to perform the data analysis on the crop price data, for that you would need the data to be in your system or database or remote database, i.e.. some accessible form, but accesing directly from website is not sort of feasible. So the simple sollution is to download the data in xls as offered on the portal and convert to csv or store to database. But, there are 344 different commodities, will you download each and every commodity separately?

The better option is Web Scraping. through web scraping and beautiful soup, we can scrape the desired data from the website and use as we want. 

So, in this repo I'll explain how i scraped the data for all 344 commodities for date ranging from 2015 to 2021.
